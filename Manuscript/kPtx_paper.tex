%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% Abstract %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\section*{\underline{Abstract}} 
{\bf Purpose:}
To accelerate the design of multidimensional parallel transmission pulses. 
\\[1em]
{\bf Methods:}
A k-space domain parallel transmission pulse design algorithm was proposed that
produces a sparse matrix relating a target excitation pattern to the pulses that produce it,
and can be finely parallelized. 
The algorithm was applied in simulations to the design of 3D SPINS pulses for inner volume excitation in the brain at 7 Tesla.
It was characterized in terms of the dependence of computation time, excitation error, and required memory
on algorithm parameters,
and it was compared to the spatial domain pulse design method in terms computation time, excitation error,
Gibbs ringing, and ability to compensate off-resonance.
\\[1em]
{\bf Results:}
The proposed algorithm achieved approximately 90\% faster pulse design compared to 
an iterative spatial domain method, with the same number of parallel threads,
with the tradeoff of increased excitation error and RMS RF amplitude. 
It reduced the memory required to store the design matrix by 98\% compared to a full matrix solution.
Even with a coarse design grid, the algorithm produced patterns that were free of Gibbs ringing.
It was similarly sensitive to k-space undersampling as the spatial domain method,
and was similarly capable of compensating for off-resonance.
\\[1em]
{\bf Conclusion:}
The proposed k-space domain algorithm accelerates and finely parallelizes parallel transmission pulse design,
with a modest tradeoff of excitation error and RMS RF amplitude.

	RF pulse weight contributions from this point.
	Inclusion width is defined as the distance from each target location $\vec{k}_j$ within which 
	which all trajectory points are considered when solving for the $j$-th column of the design ($\bm{W}$) matrix.
	(b) Calculation of the $\bm{W}$ matrix can be performed column-by-column for each target location $\vec{k}_j$,
	or patches of target points can be solved for jointly. 
	Here the 16 columns of $\bm{W}$ for a 4 $\times$ 4 patch of target points are solved together,
	and an inclusion width of 4 cycles/FOV dictates that all trajectory points within a 12 $\times$ 12 region
	centered on the patch are considered in the calculation.}
