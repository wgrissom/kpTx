@article{Katscher:2003:Magn-Reson-Med:12509830,
	Abstract = {The idea of using parallel imaging to shorten the acquisition time by the simultaneous use of multiple receive coils can be adapted for the parallel transmission of a spatially-selective multidimensional RF pulse. As in data acquisition, a multidimensional RF pulse follows a certain k-space trajectory. Shortening this trajectory shortens the pulse duration. The use of multiple transmit coils, each with its own time-dependent waveform and spatial sensitivity, can compensate for the missing parts of the excitation k-space. This results in a maintained spatial definition of the pulse profile, while its duration is reduced. This work introduces the concept of parallel transmission with arbitrarily shaped transmit coils (termed "Transmit SENSE"). Results of numerical studies demonstrate the theoretical feasibility of the approach. The experimental proof of principle is provided on a commercial MR scanner. The lack of multiple independent transmit channels was addressed by combining the excitation patterns from two separate subexperiments with different transmit setups. Shortening multidimensional RF pulses could be an interesting means of making 3D RF pulses feasible even for fast T(2)(*) relaxing species or strong main field inhomogeneities. Other applications might benefit from the ability of Transmit SENSE to improve the spatial resolution of the pulse profile while maintaining the transmit duration.},

@article{fessler2005toeplitz,
	Abstract = {In some types of magnetic resonance (MR) imaging, particularly functional brain scans, the conventional Fourier model for the measurements is inaccurate. Magnetic field inhomogeneities, which are caused by imperfect main fields and by magnetic susceptibility variations, induce distortions in images that are reconstructed by conventional Fourier methods. These artifacts hamper the use of functional MR imaging (fMRI) in brain regions near air/tissue interfaces. Recently, iterative methods that combine the conjugate gradient (CG) algorithm with nonuniform FFT (NUFFT) operations have been shown to provide considerably improved image quality relative to the conjugate-phase method. However, for non-Cartesian k-space trajectories, each CG-NUFFT iteration requires numerous k-space interpolations; these are operations that are computationally expensive and poorly suited to fast hardware implementations. This paper proposes a faster iterative approach to field-corrected MR image reconstruction based on the CG algorithm and certain Toeplitz matrices. This CG-Toeplitz approach requires k-space interpolations only for the initial iteration; thereafter, only fast Fourier transforms (FFTs) are required. Simulation results show that the proposed CG-Toeplitz approach produces equivalent image quality as the CG-NUFFT method with significantly reduced computation time.},

@article{Zhang:2007:Magn-Reson-Med:16526012,
	Abstract = {This article presents a small-flip-angle, three-dimensional tailored RF pulse that excites thin slices with an adjustable quadratic in-plane spatial variation. The quadratic spatial variation helps to compensate for the loss in image uniformity using a volume coil at 3 T due to the wavelike properties of the RF field. The pulse is based on a novel "fast-kz" design that uses a series of slice-select subpulses along kz and phase encoding "blips" along kx-ky. The method is demonstrated by acquiring a series of 5-mm-thick T2-weighted images of the human brain at 3 T using pulses 4.8 ms in length with a 45 degrees flip angle.},
